 * 
 * @brief Arduino sketch for ESP32 onbard ChickenCoop PCB.
 * 
 * @remarks
 *  Acts as a UART <-> WiFi gateway between the HMI client and onbard MCU (STM32) 
 *  on the ChickenCoop Control system.
 * 
 *  All tasks uses FreeRTOS.
 * 
 *  On the WiFi network it will transmit data packets on a fixed interval containing:
 *      - Temperature Inner/External readings.
 *      - Humidity Inner/External readings.
 *      - Current measurements for 230VAC Output #1(Heating), #2(Lights) and #3(Reserved).
 *      - Flap doors open/closed state.
 *      - Flap doors motor diagnostics.
 *      - Errors if present.
 * 
 *  It will also receive data packets from the HMI client as WiFi data packets:
 *      - Flap door to garden manual control.
 *      - Flap door to coop manual override.
 *      - Coop lights manual override.
 *      - Temperature control setting.
 * 
 * @note
 *  Chicken heads might get chopped while closing doors.
